Users can request correction or deletion of personal information, and all linked profile artifacts are purged according to a fixed deletion schedule.

No personal information is sold, licensed, or exchanged with third parties for advertising monetization.

High-risk attributes such as geolocation and biometrics remain opt-in and are disabled by default for every account.

Policy 2 - Mixed Compliance:


Section 1: Operational Clauses

We collect account and activity information to personalize experiences and maintain product quality, but retention controls differ across internal teams.

Credential data is protected with standard encryption practices, while selected telemetry signals are retained for model diagnostics over extended windows.

Users can request deletion workflows, but some analytical records are kept for ongoing experimentation and trend analysis.

We may share aggregated usage insights with strategic marketing partners, while claiming those datasets are anonymized.

Location-based services are active during feature use and can influence recommendations even when users are not explicitly reviewing privacy toggles.

Section 1: Operational Clauses

By continuing to use this platform, you grant irrevocable rights for us to collect, store, and commercialize your personal data with advertising networks.

Internal databases do not use encryption controls because plaintext processing is considered faster for business analytics and operational reporting.

All historical account records are retained indefinitely, including post-deletion traces, to support indefinite profiling and retrospective modeling.

New users are automatically opted into every data stream, including geolocation, browsing, and derived behavioral scoring, without explicit consent.

Data sharing permissions are broad by default and may include third-party enrichment vendors with limited transparency disclosures.

# **Title:**

**_“Strengthening User Privacy through AI-Driven Risk Quantification and
International Standards Alignment_**

## **Aim:**

AI-based privacy quantification is an emerging but underdeveloped field. Existing
works such as Polisis [2] and PrivacyBERT [3] automate privacy-policy analysis but
remain disconnected from international standards and lack quantifiable indicators of
user or system risk. Recent frameworks such as NIST’s AI Risk and Privacy Frameworks
[4] highlight the growing demand for measurable, interoperable privacy-risk metrics.
However, no current approach integrates AI-driven privacy analysis with standards-
based compliance measurement [1]. This project fills that gap by developing AI
methods to quantify user privacy risks in line with ISO/IEC, NIST, GDPR and related
regulations. It will deliver validated privacy metrics, a proof-of-concept tool combining
PrivacyBERT and Bayesian risk modelling, and a roadmap for scaling into a
comprehensive, standards-aligned framework which laying the foundation for
stronger privacy protection, accountability, and trust.

## **Approach:**

The project will follow four delivery-focused steps. (1) Map measurable
privacy principles from ISO/IEC, NIST, GDPR, IEEE and related regulations into
quantifiable indicators by translating clauses such as consent, data minimisation,
encryption, and third-party sharing into candidate metrics. (2) Design and test privacy-
risk metrics at user, system, and organisational levels using synthetic logs and public
breach datasets of ENISA [6] and PRC [7]. Organisation-level indicators (e.g.,
compliance time, vendor safeguards, breach response) will be partially implemented,
while digital ecosystem issues (e.g., cross-border transfers and interoperability) will
be scoped conceptually for future work. (3) Develop an AI prototype combining
transformer-based model PrivacyBERT which is fine-tuned on OPP-115 dataset [5] and
Polisis datasets [2] for clause classification with Bayesian/probabilistic models for
privacy-risk scoring. These datasets provide annotated privacy policies widely used for
training and evaluating AI models in privacy clause classification and compliance
analysis. (4) Validate and refine the prototype through benchmarking against defined
metrics, producing a validated tool and deliver final report.

## **Novelty and Expected Contribution:**

The project’s novelty lies in combining transformer-based policy analysis,
probabilistic risk modelling, and international standards mapping into a single
comprehensive quantitative framework. The earlier studies classify privacy clauses or
analyse breaches in isolation, this project will create the first standards aligned,
multi-level privacy risk quantification model which advances the state of the art in AI
enabled privacy assurance.
